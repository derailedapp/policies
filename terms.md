# Terms of Service

Last Updated: XX/XX/XXXX

This is the Derailed Terms of Service ("TOS, "Terms"). The TOS defines a set of legal obligations between you ("You," "Your," "The User") and Vincent Jose De Chico ("Derailed," "Us," "Our") concerning your usage of the Social Media service hosted and provided by Derailed and its third-party partners ("The Service," "The Platform").

You agree that you are over 13 years of age, and over the appropriate age in the country you are using Derailed in to use Social Media.

You agree that Derailed may at any time, with or without reason, suspend, limit, or remove your account with or without warning at our discretion.

## Content

Content on The Platform refers to a file, a text, an image, or any other data sent by a user to The Service.

When you create, upload, or send a piece of content onto Derailed's social network (content in this case should be generally referred to as "Track" or "Tracks") or onto Derailed's communication & messaging network (the content in this case generalized as "Message" or "Messages") you grant us and our third-party partners a perpetual, exclusive license to use that content as far as to be able to properly serve The Platform.

### Agreement of Ownership

You agree that any content you create, upload, or send on Derailed is under ownership or has the consent from the owner for your usage.

### Agreement of Moderation

You agree that any content you own on Derailed can be deleted or removed by Derailed at any time with or without reason at our discretion.

## Right to be Forgotten

At any time you may request Derailed, inside of our app or through direct contact with a member of Derailed's team to deleted data associated to you. This will make all messages, tracks, and other content you've sent become anonymous or be completed deleted from Derailed's platform.

We may temporarily deny your request to either verify your requests legitimacy, of which we only may pause for no more than 32 days. We may also block your request if you are in ownership of a Derailed Community ("Guild").
