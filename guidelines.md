# Community Guidelines

## 1: Introduction

These are the Derailed community guidelines. They determine content limits on how you communicate on our platform with others and defined ways we can judge and prosecute said communications. This document specifically does not have any effect on actions done outside of Derailed's platform.

### 1.1: Effect of New Guidelines

Unless the action is severe enough to warrant a modern punishment, posts made beyond 4 years of a new Guidelines version should be seen as only under the former version of the guidelines and in no need to follow any new modern guidelines.

## 2: Basics

### 2.1: Targeted Harassment

Maliciously targeting another user for harassment is explicitly not allowed. Depending on severity, continuity, and how involved a user is in a targeted harassment campaign it may result in Punishments 4.2.2 up to Punishments 4.1.

### 2.2: Copyrighted & Trademarked Content

Sending a message with or posting a track with copyrighted or trademarked against the owner's consent results in Punishments 4.2.1 or a notified warning considering the severity, and if repeated over 5 times in a one month period, a Punishments 4.1 will be instantiated.
### 2.3: Illegal Content

Uploading illegal text, images, and other files or content will result in Punishments 4.1. Illegal content is any content which is either by the majority of governments seen as illegal, or is considered illegal towards one majoritive country served to by Derailed and part of the United Nations.

Derailed can choose at any point whether or not a law from a specific country should be prosecuted among users or not depending on political situations, notarity, or judgement from the country or police forces.

## 3: Etcetera
### 3.1: Petitions

If a petition placed under a reliable, trusted, well-known site (e.g. `change.org`) gets 1,000,000 or more signatures, and is placed on a non-government, non-partnered, non-verified user, Derailed will give a special non Punishments-defined Year-long ban. If it reaches 10,000,000 or more signatures, Derailed will give a Punishments 4.1: Permanent Offense.

## 4. Punishments

We have a few general defined punishments which show how we may decide to prosecute your actions if they fall under one of our disallowed guidelines.

### 4.1: Permanent Offense

The offense will lead into an exclusive, permanent ban. Trying to create any new accounts to bypass this punishment will lead to the banning of those accounts under [Offense 4.1](#4.1: Permanent Offense), alongside any other accounts created before the ban.

### 4.2: Elevated Warning Offense (EWO)

This offense will lead into an exclusive, non-permanent ban, which is taken after a warning of actions and explicit non-communication or inaction of the offending user.

#### 4.2.1: Week-long

The lowest level of an EWO is the week-long EWO. It lasts 7 days and is just elevated above a notified warning.

#### 4.2.2: Month-long

The highest level of an EWO is the Month-long EWO. It lasts 32 days and is the highest possible moderation action other than Offense 4.1.
